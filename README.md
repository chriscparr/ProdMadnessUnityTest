# ProdMadnessUnityTest

Check out display 6 for a cool following camera view of the last instanciated car

Optimisations 
- Player logos loaded into spritesheet rather than loaded dynamically from a url
- Lighting set to baked rather than realtime
- Simple implementation keeps complexity low

Art Requests
- Possible to use textures more allowing the use of lower poly models?
- This game doesn't need any internal components of the vehicle at this stage

Thanks!
